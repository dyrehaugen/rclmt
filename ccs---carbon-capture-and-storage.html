<blockquote>
<p>Most existing CCS projects in the world are enhanced oil recovery projects. That means that the captured carbon is used to produce more oil, not to reduce emissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The push for offshore CCS reflects the same attitude
that has left the oceans in crisis today: treating them
as a limitless resource to exploit and a bottomless
receptacle for humanityâs waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Offshore CCS represents the next frontier of ocean
abuse by the fossil fuel industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether on land or under the sea, CCS is not a
solution to the climate crisis. Experience shows it is
costly and ineffective, and only prolongs dependence
on fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon Storage in Theory</strong>
Once COâ is captured, operators can inject it underground or under the seabed into a variety
of different geologic formations, including saline aquifers, oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams,
basalt formations, and organic shale formations.3 While storage in each of these formations
is theoretically possible, there are geologic variables at each injection site that make it difficult
to predict the behavior of the COâ underground.4 In principle, each of these formations can
hold the COâ underground at a temperature and pressure that keeps the COâ in a supercritical
state, meaning that it has properties of both a liquid and a gas. Depending on the siteâs geology,
the COâ may dissolve into some of the brine underground or trigger a chemical reaction that
slowly turns the carbon into a solid mineral, over thousands of years, but most injected COâ is
physically held underground by a seal known as a caprock.5 Descriptions of how COâ storage
may work must be interpreted in light of the limited experience with COâ sequestration to date,
the site-specific nature of geologic variations and leakage pathways, and the difficulty of tracking
these developments over geological rather than human timescales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tooze on IEA Report</em></p>
<p>One scenario that the fossil fuel industry should not comfort itself with, according to the <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/7a4b0c4e-d78c-4a8e-998c-6cde10a4e49b/TheOilandGasIndustryinNetZeroTransitions.pdf">IEA (pdf)</a>, is the idea that gigantic carbon capture will permit a continuation or even expansion of the current industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If oil and natural gas consumption were to evolve as projected under todayâs policy settings, this would require an inconceivable 32 billion tonnes of carbon captured for utilisation or storage by 2050, including 23 billion tonnes via direct air capture to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 Â°C. The necessary carbon capture technologies would require 26 000 terawatt hours of electricity generation to operate in 2050, which is more than global electricity demand in 2022. And it would require over USD 3.5 trillion in annual investments all the way from today through to mid-century, which is an amount equal to the entire industryâs annual average revenue in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the industryâs heavy reliance on carbon capture fantasies, this is a strong and important statement from the IEA.</p>
<p><a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-carbon-notes-7-the-ieas">Tooze (2023) Carbon Notes 7 - The IEAâs message to the oil and gas industry: wake up!</a></p>
<p><em>CIEL</em></p>
<p><strong>Deep Trouble</strong></p>
<p>Facing growing scrutiny over their contributions to climate change, polluting industries are increasingly looking for ways to cover up their continued emissions rather than phase out the fossil fuels driving them. One way companies claim the world can continue producing and using oil, gas, and coal without harming the climate is through carbon capture and storage (CCS), which purports to enable polluters to trap their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and bury them underground or under the seabed.</p>
<p>Despite the fanfare around CCS, it is a costly and risky endeavor and nearly all the worldâs past CCS projects have experienced unexpected problems or failed outright. The technologyâs poor track record hasnât stopped the fossil fuel industry from championing new projects, and over the last few years, companies and governments have put forward a rash of new proposals that aim to store industrial emissions offshore under the seabed.</p>
<p>A new wave of proposed projects aims to pool CO2 waste from various fossil fuel and industrial activities for injection in offshore storage âhubsâ in oceans around the world. This untested technique, which involves a step change in the scale and complexity of offshore CCS, poses uncalculated risks. Some of the envisioned hubs are associated with the buildout of new fossil fuel projects, and most would store waste from industries that must be scaled down or phased out if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p>
<p>Deep Trouble: The Risks of Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage explains the threat presented by a massive buildout of offshore CCS infrastructure and uncovers the government financing and fossil fuel interests enabling and advancing this new wave of projects. The report concludes that governments must halt the expansion of offshore CCS by ending subsidies and support for these projects, while interpreting existing laws and strengthening emerging regulations to protect the oceans from absorbing even more of humanityâs waste and safeguard communities, the environment, and the global climate.</p>
<p>**Ciel memo*</p>
<p>Until now, global experience with offshore CCS has
been based on just two projects in Norway, both of
which encountered unpredicted problems despite
their relatively simple designs and small scales. Far
from a proof of concept, those projects prove the
complexity of offshore CCS and raise serious con-
cerns about proposals to ramp it up in size and scope.</p>
<p>Injecting COâ under the seabed presents uncalcu-
lated risks and untested monitoring challenges.
Whether onshore or offshore, injecting COâ under
the Earthâs surface has the potential to contaminate
groundwater, cause earthquakes, and displace
deposits of brine, which can be toxic. These risks have
never been confronted at scale, and the magnitude
of offshore injection contemplated by proponents
would create unprecedented challenges in managing
reservoir pressure and monitoring COâ plumes
in the depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>Proposed COâ storage hubs are concentrated in
areas most prone to leaks. The single biggest risk of
COâ leakage comes from the interaction of injected
COâ with legacy oil and gas wells.</p>
<p>Offshore CCS projects are costly and largely
dependent on public subsidies. CCS is inherently
expensive, and the costs for its deployment are only
heightened offshore. These high costs are driving
industry demands for public subsidies, which effec-
tively pay polluters to bury some of their pollution
rather than require them to stop generating it in the
first place.</p>
<p>Regardless of how
the captured carbon is used, any CCS project
requires significant energy inputs and a web of
different facilities to function, and all of this infra-
structure poses risks to the public.
COâ processing facilities, for example, release large amounts of air
pollutants like sulfur dioxide, while carbon capture
equipment is known to greatly increase the amount
of ammonia that a facility spews into the air.
Running carbon capture equipment is also enormously
energy-intensive, increasing the overall emissions of
the facility where the capture equipment is installed.14
This is known as an âenergy penalty.â</p>
<p>At high concentrations, COâ is a toxic gas and
an asphyxiant capable of causing ârapid âcirculatory
insufficiency,â coma and death.â
(When a COâ
pipeline ruptured in Mississippi in 2020, dozens of
people nearby were knocked unconscious and at least
forty-five wound up in the hospital).</p>
<p>Tthe total
projected capture amount of 450 million metric
tons (tonnes) remains relatively insignificant
from a climate change perspective, amounting to
approximately 1.5 percent of current annual global
COâ emissions from energy and industry.</p>
<p>The very idea that offshore COâ storage is feasible
at all is based almost entirely on two small projects,
both in Norway. These storage ventures both
encountered problems in their early phases and
prove that COâ storage is a challenging and unpre-
dictable task.26 Moreover, uncertainties remain
regarding the permanence of storage, processes for
long-term monitoring, and liability for leaks. Many
of these risks have yet to be fully assessed, let alone
comprehensively regulated.</p>
<p><strong>Sleipner and SnÃ¸hvit</strong></p>
<p>he worldâs first offshore CCS project, called
Sleipner, began operating in 1996. The Norwegian
petroleum company Statoil (now Equinor) started
capturing COâ from its Sleipner gas field and inject-
ing it into saline reservoirs beneath the North Sea in
order to avoid paying the 1991 Norwegian COâ tax.32
In 2008, Statoil launched a second CCS project that
began capturing COâ from its offshore operations
at the SnÃ¸hvit gas field and reinjecting it beneath
the seabed.</p>
<p>In both projects, geologists failed to accurately
predict how the injected COâ would behave under-
ground. At Sleipner, the COâ migrated upward from
its intended storage point into a different layer of the
subsurface. The SnÃ¸hvit project turned out to have
significantly less storage capacity than expected, forc-
ing Equinor to sink an unplanned USD225 million
or so into identifying the problem and developing
a new storage site. A 2023 report on Sleipner and
SnÃ¸hvit from the Institute for Energy Economics and
Financial Analysis (IEEFA) points to the projectsâ
problems as evidence that storing COâ underground
is ânot an exact science,â and that CCS, even after
âextensive repeated study, using the most modern
methods, is not foolproof.â</p>
<p>Despite the significant challenges with these two
relatively simple projects, industry leaders still often
refer to Sleipner and SnÃ¸hvit as success stories that
substantiate the safety and feasibility of much larger,
more complex offshore CCS projects, such as the
hubs being proposed worldwide. The projects have
emboldened Equinor and the Norwegian govern-
ment to promote Norway as a primary destination
for COâ waste from other countries.</p>
<p>Until now, these two projects have received little
scrutiny in Norwegian political debate or in the
broader environmental movement â perhaps due in
part to the dearth of independent research into CCS
free of funding or participation by the oil and gas
industry, including at Norwegian higher education
institutions.</p>
<p>Both the Norwegian projects are relatively
small in scale: They each have a maximum injection
rate of less than 1 million tonnes per year. This
amounts to less than one thirtieth of Norwayâs
annual emissions, and pales in comparison to the
much larger ambitions of major proposed projects.</p>
<p><strong>CCS Hubs</strong></p>
<p>The pervasive concept of offshore âCCS hubsâ
introduces additional complexities beyond what
stand-alone facilities like Sleipner and SnÃ¸hvit were
designed for. Both Sleipner and SnÃ¸hvit involve
COâ captured from a single source, while many new
CCS proposals envision storing COâ from multiple
sources in one location. Because different indus-
trial processes produce COâ streams with different
chemical makeups, hub operators would need to
ensure that the substances they accept from different
industries would not damage their infrastructure
or elevate risks. Impurities like water, hydrogen
sulfide, sulfur oxides, or carbon monoxide can all be
present in industrial COâ streams at varying levels.40
These impurities can cause pipeline corrosion41 and
compound the dangers workers would face from a
blowout: Even with pure COâ, a blowout could be
deadly due to the risk of asphyxiation, but impurities
could make a rupture toxic as well.</p>
<p><strong>Denmark</strong></p>
<p>Denmarkâs embrace of CCS is at odds with its
commitment to phase out fossil fuels. As a found-
ing member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance
(BOGA) launched in 2021 at the 26th Conference
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP26),55
Denmark promised to sunset oil and gas production
domestically by 2050. And yet, the offshore CCS
projects Denmark is promoting only prolong reliance
on oil and gas.</p>
<p><strong>Longship</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian government announced
plans to launch a large-scale CCS demonstration
project in an effort to create a new market for COâ
disposal as a service across the European continent.
The project, known as Longship, would be an open-
source network of CCS infrastructure that includes
carbon capture at industrial facilities throughout
the continent, paired with transport and storage
in a sub-seabed site located off the western coast of
Norway. The Norwegian government will fund two-
thirds of the project, an estimated USD1.57 billion
(NOK 16.8 billion), while the remaining costs will
be shared among the projectâs partners.
The transport and storage component of the project,
is known as Northern Lights.</p>
<p><strong>Northen Lights</strong></p>
<p>In Norway, developments are underway for
a new offshore CCS project â led by Equinor in
partnership with Shell and Total â called Northern
Lights. The Norwegian government is providing
80 percent of the funding for the first phase.48 The
project would seek to inject 1.5 million tonnes per
year of COâ in its first phase and up to 5 million in
its second. This second phase would increase the
amount of COâ injected under the seabed by a large
margin, but even so, it remains a drop in the proverbial
bucket: The carbon injected would amount to
less than one tenth of 1 percent of Europeâs annual
COâ emissions from fossil fuels in 2021.</p>
<p>Northern Lights project involves transporting
COâ captured from European industrial facilities
by ship to an onshore receiving terminal and then
moving it back offshore via pipeline for injection
into a storage reservoir beneath the North Sea.
The subsea storage site is located about 2,600 meters (1.6
miles) beneath the seabed. Phase 1 of the project aims
to capture and store 1.5 million tonnes of COâ per
year and be operational by 2024.</p>
<p>The Longship project was initially planned to start
with carbon capture at two Norwegian facilities, the
Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik and the
Hafslund Oslo Celsio waste-to-energy plant. Con-
struction is underway at Heidelberg Materials, but
the Hasflund Oslo Celsio plant suspended the instal-
lation of carbon capture equipment in April 2023
after the project exceeded its budget.</p>
<p>Longship is seeking additional emitters within and
outside of Norway to sign onto the project, exem-
plifying how the âcarbon managementâ economy
depends on steady pollution streams. In late August
2022, the project announced an agreement with the
Norwegian fertilizer firm Yara to transport and store
COâ captured from Yaraâs Sluiskil ammonia plant in
the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Although Northern Lights is pitched as a major proj-
ect, its potential contribution to climate mitigation is
quite limited. The project aims to scale up beyond the
starting goal of storing 1.5 million tonnes of COâ per
year, adding 3.5 million tonnes of capacity to reach
5 million tonnes depending on market demand.</p>
<p>This represents a potential five-fold increase in the
offshore injection rate compared to Norwayâs flagship
Sleipner project, and with it, increased complexities.
But the scale of emissions must be kept in perspective:
Norwayâs emissions alone amounted to about 49
million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (COâe)
in 2021. The COâ volumes that this project aims
to bury â drawn from the entire continent â are
minor in comparison.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risks of offshore COâ
injection must be considered in
the context of the myriad
pressures facing global oceans and
seas, including those from
increasing temperatures,
acidification, nitrogen and other
chemical pollution, and the
proliferation of microplastics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While carbon capture equipment may reduce the COâ
emitted from a facility, it perpetuates, and can
even increase, the release of other air pollutants
that harm public health and the environment,
undermining human rights.</p>
<p>The CCS process itself presents hazards to the climate
and environment. Whether onshore or offshore,
injecting COâ under the Earthâs surface has the
potential to contaminate groundwater, cause earth-
quakes, and displace deposits of toxic brine.</p>
<p>Brines can be detrimental to surrounding sea life because
they can have salt concentrations far in excess of
seawater and can contain contaminants such as heavy
metals.</p>
<p>Preventing or mitigating hazards associated
with CCS is even more technically challenging and
expensive at great depths under the sea, where the
dynamics of COâ may be harder to ascertain than on
land and the resulting problems harder to resolve.</p>
<p>It isnât only the offshore storage of COâ that presents
possible hazards. Each stage of the CCS process
â capture, transport, injection, and storage â has
the potential to harm communities and the environ-
ment, jeopardizing the right to a clean, healthy, and
sustainable environment and other human rights.</p>
<p>Operation of
carbon capture equipment could increase emis-
sions of harmful fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
and nitrogen oxide, and significantly increase toxic
ammonia emissions.</p>
<p>Existing oil and gas pipelines, designed to withstand
much less pressure, cannot readily be repurposed for
moving large amounts of COâ.</p>
<p>A large vessel capable of storing COâ does not yet exist,
much less a fleet of them.</p>
<p>Unlike gas or oil pipelines, the risk
from a COâ pipeline rupture is not combustion, but
<strong>asphyxiation</strong>. COâ is heavily pressurized and denser
than air, so if a pipeline bursts, large volumes can
be released extremely quickly and stay close to the
ground, threatening people in a wide radius from
the release.</p>
<p>The US has the largest pipeline network in the world and only has
about 8,000 kilometers (km) (about 5,000 miles) of
active COâ pipelines, compared with 425,605 km
(about 265,000 miles) of oil and gas pipelines.</p>
<p>Although experience operating COâ pipelines is lim-
ited, extensive experience with oil and gas pipelines
makes one thing clear: <strong>Pipelines leak</strong>.
Over an eight-
year period in the US, there were more than 2,000
recorded incidents with gas pipelines alone. These
incidents resulted in more than 100 deaths and nearly
600 injuries.</p>
<p>Presence of water, contaminants, or impurities such as
hydrogen sulfide in the COâ stream increases the
risks of pipe corrosion.</p>
<p>Shipping COâ increases emissions
in one of the most difficult-to-decarbonize trans-
port sectors. Generating fossil fuel emissions to
transport fossil fuel emissions is counterproductive
at best. Refrigerating the COâ cargo â which must
be kept under high pressure and low temperature to
be transported in liquid form â and powering the
ship requires burning more fossil fuels. Research
by oil and gas industry analyst Rystad, considering
potential COâ shipping routes, found that some
vessels traveling long distances could produce
emissions equivalent to as much as 5 percent of the
COâ being transported.</p>
<p>COâ leaks would affect the
marine environment as well.
Its interactions with the sea would be complex:
hydrates and ice might form, and temperature
differences would induce strong currents. Some of
the gas would dissolve in the sea, but some would be
released to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The injection of high-pressure COâ under the seabed
is a complicated process that creates significant
risks and uncertainties beyond just leakage. The
aquifers into which COâ could be injected are not
simply empty pockets underground, but porous
rock formations that can be filled with brine, water,
sand, or other materials. CCS operators propose
injecting COâ into the âpore spaceâ that these other
substances occupy. Injecting the COâ into this
space displaces whatever was there before, elevating
the pressure underground and often pressurizing areas
well beyond the boundaries of the injection site. Too
much pressure can cause the <strong>caprock</strong>, the impervious
rock layer that seals the brine and COâ underground,
to crack, causing a leak. Operators must also limit
pressure build up in order to avoid triggering earth-
quakes, a known risk with any subsurface injection.</p>
<p>Brine can leak
from pipelines and needs to be properly managed
and disposed of to avoid contaminating the
environment. As acknowledged in an EU-funded
report involving Statoil (now Equinor), the high
salinity of brine can be toxic to benthic (deep sea)
organisms like coral and sea anemones.</p>
<p>If brine is allowed to percolate to
the surface of the seabed, such brines could cause
a ten-fold increase in local salinity in surface sediments
and seabed depressions, thus representing a
potentially severe source of osmotic shock to
benthic organisms.</p>
<p>New studies demonstrate the risks of
assuming that the ocean has a vast storage capacity.
Researchers warn that the dynamics within each
individual geologic formation are unpredictable,
and that macro estimates of geologic storage capacity
are likely flawed.</p>
<p>Building out industrial-scale CCS may not be
as feasible as current regional inventories suggest and
pressure management techniques may not function
as planned.</p>
<p>Legacy deposits of oil in offshore
wells can react with injected COâ to form bitumen,
a viscous hydrocarbon substance, creating blockages
and reducing the ability to inject more COâ.</p>
<p>If CCS
is widely deployed onshore and offshore, even
a 0.1 percent leakage rate could cause up to 25
gigatonnes of additional COâ emissions in the 21st
century, posing a major risk to the climate.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that legacy oil and gas wells pose
the single greatest risk of COâ leakage at offshore
storage sites, the areas being heavily targeted for
offshore CCS development are precisely those zones
where old wells abound: sites of long-standing oil
and gas drilling.</p>
<p>There is little reason to believe
that injecting COâ into areas
where countless existing leaks
from oil and gas wells go
undetected or unreported would
guarantee âpermanentâ storage.</p>
<p>In the event of a storage well failure or other extreme
release of COâ offshore, the problem may be very
difficult, if not impossible, to correct.</p>
<p>COâ
might cause wells to fail due to its incompatibility
with certain commonly used materials.</p>
<p>If there is a leaking COâ well or a blowout, the mitiga-
tion measures used for oil and gas well accidents, like
a physical barrier, wonât work to contain COâ. The
only option may be to stop injection altogether.</p>
<p>Significant uncertainties about the long-term
performance of a COâ storage site should be
resolved prior to injection of large volumes of
COâ; if uncertainties cannot be resolved, injection
should be stopped.</p>
<p>If injection is halted,
the COâ that would have been captured to supply
the injection site will end up simply vented into
the atmosphere, assuming the underlying emitting
activity is not also paused. This would undermine
any climate rationale for operating a carbon capture
system in the first place.</p>

<p>Oxford University conducted a massive study of the phenomena known as rights law, the cost-reduction curves for technologies, and weâve seen in our lives some stunning examples: the mobile phones, the flat screen TVs, not to mention computer chips.</p>
<p>And so they studied all of them, and some go down in cost very rapidly, some a bit slowly. They have a very small category labelled non-improving technologies. Thatâs the category that carbon capture and sequestration is in. For 50 years, there has been zero reduction in cost for carbon capture and sequestration. ZERO.</p>
